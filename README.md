ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arturlaskowski. \
I'm a Java software developer. \
I enjoy sharing knowledge that's why I teach at the Lodz University of technology or record courses. \
You can also find my content on the YouTube channel: [@javaseniorpl](https://www.youtube.com/@javaseniorpl) and on the blog: [javasenior.pl](https://javasenior.pl).

I believe that if you understand something well enough, you can explain it simply. \
I like challenges and feel comfortable as a leader. 
I feel I am learning all the time and I know that there is still a long way to go. \
Over time I understood that some basic concepts we start to comprehend only with experience. \
These "aha" moments are my favorite ones and I hope there will be many more of them ahead of me.
