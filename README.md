ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arturlaskowski. \
I'm a Java software developer. \
I enjoy sharing knowledge that's why I teach at the Lodz University of technology or record courses. \
I believe that if you understand something well enough, you can explain it simply. \
I like challenges and feel comfortable as a leader. 
I started a football team and played for 4 years as a captain. \
I have organized a charity event called #pet16challenge https://psi-rap.pl/. \
I feel I am learning all the time and I know that there is still a long way to go. \
Over time I understood that some basic concepts we start to comprehend only with experience. \
These "aha" moments are my favorite ones and I hope there will be many more of them ahead of me.
